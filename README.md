### Thoughts and troubles
- I was build getting build error on both netlify and vercel, when i hosted it after including all json package file excluding node_modules.
- I was stuck for like a day and there was no solution still. I ended up using the tailwind cdn to host it
  
### What I learned and used
- I wanted to make the page have two colors taking 60%/40% of the page, but i decided to try out using animated image gotten from [giphy.com] and color
- i used a special font called venusta for the logo gotten from [1001font.com]
